# This is the ansible inventory host file. Replace the IP
# addresses accordingly.
#
# Both hosts specified here must have connectivity to each other:
#  * Oneprovider contacts OpenFaaS to schedule jobs.
#  * OpenFaaS contacts the Oneprovider to return job results.
#  * Auxiliary machinery running on the OpenFaaS host report the activity and status
#    of the cluster to the Oneprovider.

[openfaas]
  # By default the ansible script is run on the openfaas VM.
  # If this is not the case place the correct value for ansible_host.
  openfaas-vm ansible_host=assign_me   # e.g. localhost, 10.42.15.80
[oneprovider]
  # The host where the Oneprovider service is already running
  # (ansible will adjust its configuration and restart it).
  oneprovider-vm ansible_host=assign_me   # e.g. localhost, 10.42.15.81
