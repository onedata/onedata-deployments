# OpenFaaS deployments

OpenFaaS and the components needed to run automation tasks in Onedata
can be easily installed with the supplied ansible playbooks - see
[ansible/README.md](ansible/README.md). 

Alternatively, if you want to do it the hard way and deploy OpenFaaS manually, 
see [manual/README.md](ansible/README.md).
